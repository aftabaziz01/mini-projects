      <h2>Discover the Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to a world where design meets motion. This parallax website is
        not just about scrolling — it's about storytelling. As you move down the
        page, elements shift at different speeds, creating depth and immersion.
        It transforms a simple webpage into an interactive visual journey.
        Modern web design is no longer static — it breathes, it moves, and it
        engages the user in a dynamic way.

        Nature inspires creativity. The mountains, forests, and skies remind us
        of perspective — the deeper you look, the more you discover. Just like
        nature, good design has layers. Parallax scrolling creates that layered
        illusion, making content feel alive and immersive. Slow down, scroll,
        and enjoy the visual rhythm.

      <p>
        Every line of code has a purpose. Every section tells a story. Great
        websites are built with creativity, clarity, and consistency. Parallax
        design adds depth, but the real magic lies in thoughtful structure and
        clean styling. When creativity meets coding, experiences are born.
